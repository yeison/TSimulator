Description: The simulator takes an interaction network, and outputs a variety of mRNA transcript values for any given period of time.  The values are provided by a differential equation solver.  This solver evaluates a system of ordinary differential equations.  It evaluates the interactions that are occurring at every timestep, in order to approximate transcript values for the next time point.  The size of the timestep has a default value, but it may also be provided by the user.  The user may also utilize some of the functions to simulate a microarray assay experiment.  The goal is to offer a variety of functions, one to model each type of experimental paradigm.  The paradigms available will be something along the lines of (a) replication, (b) no replication with closely clustered measurements, (c) no replication with diffuse clustering of measurements.
